# Learning Rust

This is the start of my journey to learn Rust as an experienced developer.

This is just a token of my desire to learn Rust to create awesome software in fields I haven't explored yet.

Some projects that I want to try:

- A text editor
- A compiler
- A chat (state manager) server
- Something difficult, like cryptography, Zero-trust protocols, bloclchain, etc, would be awesome

Now let's get started!
